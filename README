Slickback integrates Backbone and SlickGrid, extending Backbone 
collections to support pagination and filtering ("scoping"), and
adapting them to serve as SlickGrid "DataView" objects. Detailed 
documentation can be found on the Slickback wiki:

  http://github.com/teleological/slickback/wiki

A simple example can be found here:

Slickback was developed with Backbone v0.5.3 and SlickGrid v1.4.3,
and may or may not work with other versions of these libraries.
Compatibility patches are welcome.

Thanks to Jeremy Ashkenas and Michael Leibman for Backbone and SlickGrid,
and to Pivotal Labs and Benjamin Arthur Lupton for the Jasmine and
Buildr tools used to test and build Slickback.
