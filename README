Slickback integrates Backbone and SlickGrid, extending Backbone 
collections to support pagination and filtering ("scoping"), and
adapting them to serve as SlickGrid "DataView" objects.

The easiest way to use Slickback is to extend Slickback.PaginatedCollection 
rather than Backbone.Collection, e.g.:

  var productsCollection = Slickback.PaginatedCollection.extend({
    model: Product,
    url:   '/products'
  });

An instance of the collection can be passed to Slick.Grid's constructor:

  var products = new productsCollection();
  var gridOptions = {
    formatterFactory: Slickback.BackboneModelFormatterFactory
  };
  var grid = new Slick.Grid('#grid',products,productColumns,gridOptions);

BackboneModelFormatterFactory makes the grid use Backbone.Model's "get"
method to retrieve field values, which otherwise would be treated as
model object attributes.

The collection can also be used with a Slick.Controls.Pager:

  var pager = new Slick.Controls.Pager(products,grid,$('#pager'));

The pager subscribes to "onPagingInfoChanged" notifications, which the
collection will publish when it receives new pagination parameters from 
a fetch. The pager uses the "setPagingOptions" method to update the 
collection with new pagination parameters, refreshing the collection's
contents.

Slickback assumes pagination parameters (both those passed to the
collection data source and those received from the data source)
follow a naming convention similar to that used by Ruby's WillPaginate
library.

Slickback was developed with Backbone v0.5.3 and SlickGrid v1.4.3,
and may or may not work with other versions of these libraries.
Compatibility patches are welcome.
