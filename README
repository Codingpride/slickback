Slickback integrates Backbone and SlickGrid, extending Backbone 
collections to support pagination and filtering ("scoping"), and
adapting them to serve as SlickGrid "DataView" objects. Detailed 
documentation can be found on the Slickback wiki:

Slickback was developed with Backbone v0.9.1 and SlickGrid v2.0
(commit 57c0a44) and may or may not work with other versions of these
libraries. Slickback v0.2.0 will work with versions of Backbone as old 
as v0.5.3, but for older versions of SlickGrid (esp v1.4.3), use an
older version of Slickback such as v0.2.1. Compatibility patches are
welcome.

Thanks to Jeremy Ashkenas and Michael Leibman for Backbone and SlickGrid,
and to Pivotal Labs and Benjamin Arthur Lupton for the Jasmine and
Buildr tools used to test and build Slickback.
